#Dillon Kerr Phil Winchester README
#COM313 Final Project Finding Nash Equilibrium in Directed Network Design

This program uses Python 2.7.9 and the Networkx Library. 

Files:
buttonClass.py
graphics.py
GuiHandler.py
testGraph.py

Installing the Networkx Library:
To install networkx you need to 'cd' into the networkx folder in Terminal. Once in the networkx-master folder type 'python setup.py install' and this will run the install script created by the creators of the networkx library. Now you can use networkx for all your networking needs.

How To Execute:
To run our program you need to run the testGraph.py file, as long as it is in a folder with the other files listed above and you have installed the Networkx Library. This will create the graph with a fixed number of nodes and edges. In the GUI you can run the program by clicking the "Find Paths!" button and see the outputted paths. If you click the "Enter Weights!" button then you will be prompted to input custom weights in a fixed order, meaning that you have to enter the edge (S1, A) first then (A, S2) and so forth in that order. If at anypoint you want to reset the program then there is a "Reload Graph" button in the top left which will reload the GUI Winodow. Finally to end the program click the "Quit" button. 


Thanks for a great semester and I hope you have a relaxation summer!!!!

All the best, Phil and Dillon
